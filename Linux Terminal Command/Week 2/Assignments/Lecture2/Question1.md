ðŸ§  Question 1: Breadcrumb Hunt (Reverse Engineer Your Path)

Scenario:
You are inside a terminal session, and you notice pwd has been disabled. The prompt doesnâ€™t show your path, and youâ€™re unsure where you are.

There is a file in the current directory called README.txt. You are told this file contains a hint about your current directory path.

Task:

Open the README.txt file using a basic command to check its contents.

From the information inside the file, figure out your full path.

Then, move two levels up from your current location using a relative path.
