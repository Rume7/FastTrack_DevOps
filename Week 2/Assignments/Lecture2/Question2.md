ðŸ§  Question 2: Simulated Log Management Task

Scenario:
You are helping a system admin simulate log rotation in a training environment.

Inside your home directory, you have a folder called log_sim/.

Inside log_sim/, create a text file named logfile.txt that contains numbers from 1 to 1000, each on a new line.

Use head and tail to preview:

1.The first 5 lines
2.The last 5 lines

Rename the file to logfile_1.txt using mv.

Create a new empty logfile.txt and append the following lines:

"--- New log begins here ---"
Then, append numbers 1001 to 1020 using seq >>.

Finally, use less to scroll and view the full contents of the updated logfile.txt.
